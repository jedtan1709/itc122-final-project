                                <p> Since its inception in 2006, AU-INP has been producing globally competitive nurses through academic partnerships with internationally known prestigious institutions. Last November 6, 2023, INP students and their parents and guardians greatly enjoyed an informative session on what to prepare and expect for their transfer to Edith Cowan University, one of INP’s partner school located in Perth, Australia, after completing their courses in Arellano University.

                                   <br><br> The event was graciously attended by three speakers who shared their knowledge and valuable insights for a seamless transition to ECU and eventually graduate with an Australian Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree. The speakers included Ms. Princess Bonifacio, Regional Manager for Southeast Asia of Edith Cowan University, Mr. Mark Flores of Pearson Education, and Ms. Monette Fetalvero of BADA Philippines.
                                    
                                   <br><br>The attendees were further pleased with the question and answer forum at the end of the session and went home delighted with fun facts about ECU, Australia as a country of opportunities, and winning raffle prizes.
